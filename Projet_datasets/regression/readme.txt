About this dataset
This dataset provides comprehensive experimental data on the energy usage of appliances in a low-energy building, with detailed information about temperature, humidity, and other weather conditions. Data was averaged over 10 minute periods from four and a half months' worth of measurements collected using a ZigBee wireless sensor network. Additional climate data from Chievres Airport in Belgium was merged into the dataset for further analysis. The data can be used to generate regression models that predict energy usage for various home appliances. Additionally, two random variables have been included in order to test different models and eliminate non-predictive attributes (parameters). This dataset is an invaluable resource for researchers looking to gain insights into how household energy usage changes with varying environmental factors such as temperature or humidity levels. By exploring this comprehensive dataset, researchers can gain valuable knowledge about how their findings might relate to real-world scenarios in low-energy buildings around the world!

How to use the dataset
If you are looking to analyze energy usage and temperature in a low-energy building, then this dataset will be useful for you. The “Appliances Energy Usage Data from a Low-Energy Building” dataset contains data collected over 4.5 months at 10 minute intervals of energy use, temperature, humidity and other weather conditions within the building. Using this dataset, it is possible to generate regression models in order to better understand how different variables affect energy use within this project scope.

Research Ideas
Develop an energy efficiency monitoring app with alerts that identifies and notifies users when their appliances become inefficient in order to reduce energy use and bills.
Develop a predictive weather and energy forecasting tool that uses weather data from Chievres Airport along with appliance data to accurately forecast utility usage for businesses or homeowners in advance so that they can calculate future budgets more efficiently.
Create an AI based smart home assistant that uses this dataset as foundations to better advise users on efficient ways of using their appliances while also taking into account environmental conditions such as humidity and temperature outside the building in order to recommend better settings for the household appliances according to external state of things as well individual households needs
