 # Energy efficiency

Data Set Information:
Eenergy analysis was performed using 12 different building shapes simulated in Ecotect. 
The buildings differ with respect to the glazing area, the glazing area distribution, and the orientation, amongst other parameters. 
We simulate various settings as functions of the afore-mentioned characteristics to obtain 768 building shapes. 
The dataset comprises 768 samples and 8 features, aiming to predict two real valued responses. 
It can also be used as a multi-class classification problem if the response is rounded to the nearest integer.

Adding cooling load and heating load can define the overall load of the apartment. 
Study the trend of overall load and divide it into three classes, low efficient, high efficient and average efficient. 
Then train a deep learning model to predict the label. 


The dataset contains eight attributes (or features, denoted by X1...X8) and two responses (or outcomes, denoted by y1 and y2). 
Specifically: 
	X1	Relative Compactness 
	X2	Surface Area 
	X3	Wall Area 
	X4	Roof Area 
	X5	Overall Height 
	X6	Orientation 
	X7	Glazing Area 
	X8	Glazing Area Distribution 
	y1	Heating Load 
	y2	Cooling Load
